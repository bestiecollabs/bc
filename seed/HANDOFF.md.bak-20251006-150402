## Where we left off
- Home and Login pages aligned to the same structure (hero + section wrappers).
- Home: eye icon added; login logic mirrors `/login`; “Forgot Password?” text fixed; card-section gap tightened via `style="padding-top:0px"` on the second section.
- Login: card width narrowed locally; Remember Me under password on a single line; links centered; redirect if authed.

## Files
- `C:\bc\cloudflare\html\index.html` (homepage) — includes eye icon and fixed login logic.
- `C:\bc\cloudflare\html\login\index.html` — final /login markup and logic.
- `C:\bc\cloudflare\html\air.css` — canonical theme file; no global narrowing added in this pass.

## Next steps
1) Centralize minimal Remember-row styles into `/air.css` **only if** we need this pattern on other pages (get approval first).
2) Implement `/account/` dashboard shell if missing, and ensure `/auth/session` schema is documented.
3) Add basic form-level error messages for home login, mirroring `/login` messages exactly.
4) Confirm D1 migrations and auth endpoints are stable in Functions, and document errors returned by `/auth/login` and `/auth/session`.

## Run/Deploy
- Local: `wrangler pages dev .`
- Ensure `/air.css` is present at the root in the output. Avoid multiple theme files.

## Notes
- Do not store passwords client-side.
- Avoid introducing page-specific CSS into `/air.css` unless approved.
- Keep the `brandmark` class on the header logo everywhere.
