## Workflow rule: keep git commands separate

- Do not include git add/commit/push in the same PowerShell script as file-editing or refactor commands.
- Provide git commands as a separate snippet after successful script execution.
- Default repo root: C:\bc\cloudflare\html\
- Preferred shell: PowerShell 7.5.x
